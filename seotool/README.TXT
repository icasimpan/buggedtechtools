What is SEOTOOL?
  --> As of the moment, this tool only contains one tool: the one that would be used for getting the most important section of a website's page(TITLE, META DESCRIPTION and META KEYWORDS). I don't have a name for
the tool but we could call it title_n_metas_getter.

What comprises title_n_metas_getter?
  --> It is composed of the page crawler(page-crawler)  and the page summarization (process_raw_report) scripts. As the name suggests, page-crawler crawls or gets the pages listed in the corresponding config file(located in the "conf" directory) and process_raw_reports is the one that gets the important sections
of the page, saving it in a single summary file.
